    <h1>Registers</h1>
    <p>
      There are $(VM.CPU.REGISTER_COUNT) registers.
      Each register is $(VM.CPU.REGISTER_SIZE*8) bits.
      They are generic registers used to store integers, floating point numbers, and pointers.
      Only STATUS and INS are treated as special flags to some instructions.

    <h1>Instruction Set</h1>
    <p>
      The instruction set is $(VM.CPU.INSTRUCTION_SIZE*8) bit, little endian: the lowest byte comes first.
      It is designed to be somewhat usable without an assembler.
      Some instructions are followed by a register sized value.
